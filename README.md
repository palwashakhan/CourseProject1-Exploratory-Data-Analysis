# CourseProject1-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
# This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption)
# For this project we are using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” 
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 
Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 
For this project the task is to reconstruct the 4 plots.
